## Search Engine for CS6200  
This project was part of our CS 6200 Information Retrieval course. We built a customizable search engine, that could run searches on various different configurations based on criteria such as different retrieval models, indexing models. The objective was to evaluate how these different configurations affected search results on the CACM dataset.
